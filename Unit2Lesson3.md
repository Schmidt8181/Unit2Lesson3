"Categorize each of the following research questions as "good" or "bad", and provide alternative formulations for the bad ones. Save your responses in a document of some kind, submit a link below, and discuss your reasoning with your mentor."

* What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
-Good question. Can be easily look up incarceration rates for juveniles for that year. 

* What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
-Bad question. Many questions in one. "What factors play a rold in juvenile delinquency?" "Has any previous program combating juvenile delinquency had success?" "what factors did they track?"

-Good question. This question can be answered with numbers. 

* How many customers does AT&T currently serve in Washington, DC?
-Bad question. How many customers AT&T 'serves' in the DC area can be reframed as 
    -"How many individual users are connected to the ATT towers located in DC?" or "How many ATT customers have DC addresses?"
    
* What factors lead consumers to choose AT&T over other service providers?
-Good question. This question can be answered with measurable metrics.

* How can AT&T attract more customers?
-Bad question. Ambiguous and not answerable with a mathematical model. Attracting new customers is complicated. "Does customer service interactions have more of an impact on customer retention than low prices?"

* Why did the Challenger Shuttle explode?

* Which genes are associated with increased risk of breast cancer?
-Good question. Can easily measure genes present in breast cancer patients and see common genes emerge.

-Bad question. "Better" is variable from family to family. "Do student grades improve when read to at home?" is something that can be measured
* How does Googleâ€™s search algorithm work?
-Good question, but not a research question. This is search engine optimization.
